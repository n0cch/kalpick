## Windows Defender Warning

When running KalPick.exe for the first time, Windows Defender may show an "unknown publisher" warning. This occurs because the program is not digitally signed. To run the program:

1. Click "More info" on the warning dialog.
2. Click "Run anyway" to start the program.

This program is safe.
